# Background
Chemical pesticides have long been known to have severely detrimental ecological effects. As such, non-chemical pesticides is a very active field of research. 

One promising alternative is UVC light, which has been shown to be capable of killing various fungi

and pests

).

An important factor in determining the viability of UVC light is even delivery througout the plant canopy. 
For plants with a dense canopy, simply hanging UVC lights overtop of a plant bed is not necessarily viable, since the bottom of the canopy will receive significantly less irradation than the top. 
In order for the bottom of the canopy to receive sufficient irradiation to kill pests, the top of the canopy will receive so much light that not only are all pests killed but the plant 
is also damaged. 

In order to understand how UVC light is filtered by the plant canopy and what lighting array can sufficiently deliver UVC light to all areas of the canopy, a DAQ was designed to allow
the placement of many UVC sensors within the canopy.
